                All selected packages have a 12-month duration from the start of

                thereafter until you decide to discontinue or cancel your
                subscription. If you cancel your subscription before the start
                of a new rolling cycle, you will not be billed for the next
                payment cycle, and your information will be removed.

                although we strive to ensure we reach every quota under selected
                packages, we cannot guarantee this number will be reached.
