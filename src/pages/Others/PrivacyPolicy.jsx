                cookies, non-cookie-based tokens, web server logs, tracking
                pixels, and web beacons. Cookies are files that websites send to

                your browser uniquely or to store information or settings in
                your browser. Your browser may tell you when you receive certain

              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                Personal data that you provide directly to us will be apparent
                from the context in which you provide it, for example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you fill out a form on our Site, you will generally provide

                  by the form, such as the reason for your enquiry or your

                If you fill out a form when signing up for or obtaining access
                to our products and services, you will generally provide your
                name, contact details and any other information requested by the
                form. Each form on our Site varies in the information required
                and collected. In most cases, an asterisk (*) indicates the
                required information on a form. You may choose to provide
                additional information within fields that are not required.

              <h3>Information That We Collect Automatically</h3>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                Our web servers may log information such as your operating
                system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as
                well as the language your system uses and the country and time
                zone where your device is located. The web server logs may also
                record information such as the address of the web page that
                referred you to our Sites and the IP address of the device you
                use to connect to the Internet. They may also log information
                about your interaction with the Sites, such as which pages you
                visit. To control which web servers collect information by
                automated means, we may place tags called “web beacons” — small
                files that link web pages to particular web servers and their
                cookies. We may also collect information from your browser, such
                as your browsing history, and use it in conjunction with data
                gathered from forms and e-mails to help us understand and
                respond to your needs.
              </p>
              <h3>“Do Not Track” Signals</h3>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                Your browser settings may allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track”
                signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many
                other websites and online services, we do not currently process
                or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser or to
                other mechanisms that enable choice. Both we and others (such as
                our service providers) may collect personal data about our
                visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party
                websites.
              </p>
              <h3>Social Media Widgets</h3>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                The Site includes social media functions, such as the Blog,
                Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook widgets. These widgets may
                collect information about which pages you visit on the Site and
                the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
                The widgets may also set a cookie to ensure the features are
                functioning properly.
              </p>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                Social media functions and widgets are hosted either by a third
                party or directly on the Site. Your interactions with the social
                media functions and widgets located on the Site are governed by
                the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. If you
                use any of the social media functions or widgets on our Site, we
                strongly suggest you review the privacy policies of the
                companies that provide those functions and features.
              </p>
              <h3>LinkedIn Members</h3>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                If you are a LinkedIn member and you visit our Site from
                LinkedIn, our Site may use tracking pixels — transparent graphic
                images placed on web pages — which, in combination with cookies,
                collect information contained within your LinkedIn profile as
                well as your access of and interaction with the web pages that
                contain the pixels.
              </p>
              <h3>Information That We Obtain From Third Parties</h3>
              <p className="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
                Information that we collect from third parties will generally
                consist of publicly-available profile information (such as your
                preferences and interests), for example from public social media
                posts.

                as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we
                collected it. We will then delete the personal data, unless we
                are legally required to retain it or if we need to retain it in
                order to comply with our legal obligations (for example, for tax
                and accounting purposes).
